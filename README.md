# Overview
This repository contains a project for detecting and recognizing car license plates using YOLOv8 and a Streamlit application. The project involves detecting license plates in images and videos, performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from detected plates, and displaying results with enhanced visual appeal


# YOLOv8 Model
YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is an advanced object detection model designed for real-time detection. It improves upon previous versions by enhancing accuracy and speed. YOLOv8 uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from images, making it suitable for applications requiring fast and accurate object detection.
