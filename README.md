# License-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition-Yolov8

# Overview
This repository contains a project for detecting and recognizing car license plates using YOLOv8 and a Streamlit application. The project involves detecting license plates in images and videos, performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from detected plates, and displaying results with enhanced visual appeal


YOLOv8 Model
YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is an advanced object detection model designed for real-time detection. It improves upon previous versions by enhancing accuracy and speed. YOLOv8 uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from images, making it suitable for applications requiring fast and accurate object detection.

How It Works
Detection: YOLOv8 detects objects (license plates) by predicting bounding boxes and class scores in a single forward pass through the network.

Recognition: After detecting license plates, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is performed to extract readable text from the detected plates.

Applications
YOLOv8 and similar object detection models have wide-ranging applications, including:

Surveillance: Monitoring and identifying vehicles in security footage.
Traffic Management: Automating toll collection and monitoring traffic flow.
Parking Systems: Managing parking spaces and identifying vehicles.
Law Enforcement: Assisting in vehicle identification and tracking.
